DESCRIPTION

This is a simple program for joining two table files, in a similar manner to
how SQL and other such relational databases execute join functions between two
tables.



REQUIREMENTS (SYSTEM)

This program runs in Python 2. It will not work properly with Python 3.
Please ensure you have Python 2 installed on your computer.
Please ensure you are using the correct version of Python to run this program.



INSTRUCTIONS (HOW TO USE)

You don't need to know how to use git to use this program. You can simply open
"Join.py" in your online browser and copy it's contents onto a local file on 
your computer with the same name.

To run the program, open up a command line window and enter the following
command (substituting the appropriate file paths) to bring up the help doc:

    C:\Path\To\Python\python.exe C:\Path\To\The\File\Join.py -h

You should get a large wall of text explaining how to use this program, along
with some examples.

Alternatively, Join.py code can be used as a module by other Python programs 
using standard import methods.



OTHER USEFUL TOOLS

The Table_To_Table.py tool (https://github.com/AHCChan/Table_To_Table) is a
useful general purpose tool for dealing with data in a table file format. (Such
as TSVs and CSVs) It can be used to filter out data columns and rearrange them.
It can also filter out entires which do or do not contain certain values in
certain fields.
